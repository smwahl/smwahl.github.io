## Abstract 

During the final stages of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft flew between the
planet and its rings, providing a new view on this spectacular system (see the
Perspective by Ida). Setting the scene, Spilker reviews the numerous discoveries made
using Cassini during the 13 years it spent orbiting Saturn. Iess et al. measured the
gravitational pull on Cassini, separating the contributions from the planet and the
rings. This allowed them to determine the interior structure of Saturn and the mass
of its rings. Buratti et al. present observations of five small moons located in and
around the rings. The moons each have distinctive shapes and compositions, owing to
accretion of ring material. Tiscareno et al. observed the rings directly at close
range, finding complex features sculpted by the gravitational interactions between
moons and ring particles. Together, these results show that Saturn's rings are
substantially younger than the planet itself and constrain models of their origin.
