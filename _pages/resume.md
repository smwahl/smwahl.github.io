## Software and Data
* Designed algorithms for and developed a software package to calculate self-consistent gravitational fields for fluid planets in C++ and Fortran; with plans to distribute it to the community.
* Modified and utilized code on massively parallel machines to perform novel types of first-principles quantum chemistry simulations.
* Implemented system for storing and analyzing simulation results using Python and statistical mechanics methods.
* Performed a statistical study of the relation between social media and billboard success as part of the 2015 CDIPS Data Science Workshop at UC Berkeley.

## Project Design
* Collaborated with the science team for NASA’s JUNO spacecraft mission, presenting the initial analysis of Jupiter’s gravity measurements. Developed a computational framework and methods for analyzing gravitational data and comparing to state-of-the-art models of planet interiors.
* Designed and carried out research projects applying first-principles quantum chemistry techniques to outstanding problems in planetary science. Co-authored grant proposals to the NSF and NASA. Presented results at internationally recognized conferences and in peer-reviewed journal articles, including 5 first author publications.

## Leadership
* Co-led a project with a multi-disciplinary team of young scientists as part of the Cooperative Institute for Dynamic Earth Research 2014 Summer Program.
* Co-organized the weekly seminar for the Center for Integrative Planetary Science. Selected and hosting visiting speakers from around the country and maintained the CIPS website. Helped migrate the physical seminar to a remote seminar for the COVID lockdown.
* Mentored visiting scholars from Japan and other U.S. Universities. Aided them in designing research projects with resources available through my research group at UC Berkeley.
* Developed tutorials on scientific computing, data analysis and visualization in Python for an undergraduate class and for other researchers through the Berkeley Chapter of The Hacker Within.
* Volunteered as part of the Bay Area Scientists in Schools developing material to help bay area middle school students understand geological processes going on beneath their feet.
