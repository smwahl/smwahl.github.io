My research focused on combining numerical simulations of materials at high-pressure
and temperature with global-scale physical models for planet structure and evolution.
This required developing computational skills including: algorithm design and
optimization, programming for parallel computing, data visualization and statistical
analysis. Perhaps more importantly, research has given me extensive experience in
approaching complex problems in an effective, quantitative manner.  It also led me to
focus on communicating results both in writing and verbally, and in both technical
and non-technical contexts, and in collaborating as a part of a large team with the
Juno spacecraft science team.
