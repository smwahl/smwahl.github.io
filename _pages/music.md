I play traditional Irish and Scottish music on anglo concertina, low whistle and
Irish bouzouki. Here are some samples.

March and hornpipe on concertina.

[ The Old Cross/Bobby Casey's](/assets/audio/180821_old_cross_bobby_caseys.wav)

Air and highland on low whistle.

[ Thagh Mi Sgith/The Brown Sailed Boat]( /assets/audio/180821_brown_sailed_boat.wav )

Three jigs on concertina accompanied by Laurel North on harp.

[ Up in the Air/ The Rolling Waves/ The Roling Waves](/assets/audio/up_in_the_air.mp3)

A waltz I wrote and recorded on Irish bouzouki, low whistle and harmonium.

[ Shaped by the Stream ](/assets/audio/shaped_by_the_steam_mix.mp3?autoplay=1&loop=1&controls=0)


I regularly play at sessions and for dancers with the Starry Plough Ceili Band, the
longest running traditional Irish ceili dance west of Ireland (that I know of).
