Throughout my research I have also been mindful of many shortcomings in the way
software and data analysis is typically approached in an academic setting. Early on I
switched to Python as my programming language of choice, even though it was uncommon
in the field. The change led me to focus more on programming style, distribution
methods, testing and reproducibility. Outside of my own research, I made a specific
effort to learn about important topics and developments in data science through
courses, seminars held by the Berkley Institute for Data Science, and my own personal
side-projects.
